🚀 AI-Powered Cloud Guardian – Auto-Healing & Root Cause Analysis
🔥 The AI system that predicts, explains, and fixes cloud failures BEFORE they happen!
💡 AWS only detects failures after they happen—our AI prevents them from happening at all!

🤔 The Problem: Why Did We Build This?
🚨 Cloud servers crash, apps go down, and companies lose millions!
💀 AWS Auto Scaling only reacts AFTER failures occur.
💀 Engineers spend hours debugging logs manually.

👉 Why wait for failure when we can STOP IT before it happens?

🛠️ The Solution: AI-Powered Auto-Healing!
💡 Our AI system does 4 things:

✅ 1️⃣ Fetches Cloud Logs → Collects AWS CloudWatch logs (CPU, Memory, Errors).
✅ 2️⃣ Predicts Failures Before They Happen → AI detects patterns in server failures.
✅ 3️⃣ Finds the Root Cause → AI reads logs & tells WHY the failure is happening.
✅ 4️⃣ Fixes Issues Automatically → AI restarts, scales up, or clears logs before a crash.

🚀 End Result? ZERO downtime, NO manual debugging, and an UNBREAKABLE cloud!

⚙️ How It Works (Step by Step)
📂 1️⃣ Log Collector: Fetches real-time logs from AWS CloudWatch.
🧠 2️⃣ AI Model: Analyzes logs and predicts failures before they happen.
🔎 3️⃣ Root Cause Analysis: Finds the exact reason for the failure.
🛠 4️⃣ Auto-Healing System: Takes action (restart instance, optimize memory, scale up).
📢 5️⃣ Alerts: Sends Slack/Email alerts with failure details.

🔥 AWS doesn’t do this. WE DO. 🔥
